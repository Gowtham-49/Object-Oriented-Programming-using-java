Week 2
Consider a sequence of the form 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81, 149…

Write a method program which takes as parameter an integer n and prints the nth term of the above sequence. The nth term will fit in an integer value.

Example Input:

5

Output:

4

Example Input:

8

Output:

24

Example Input:

11

Output:

149


For example:

Input	Result
5
4
8
24
11
149


import java.util.*;
public class Sequence {
    public static int findNthTerm(int n){
        if(n==1) return 0;
        if (n==2) return 1;
        if(n==3) return 1;
        int t1 = 0, t2 = 1, t3=1,tn=0;
        for(int i=4;i<=n;i++){
            tn=t1+t2+t3;
            t1=t2;
            t2=t3;
            t3=tn;
        }
        return tn;
    }
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int result = findNthTerm(n);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}

Question text
You have recently seen a motivational sports movie and want to start exercising regularly. Your coach tells you that it is important to get up early in the morning to exercise. She sets up a schedule for you:

On weekdays (Monday - Friday), you have to get up at 5:00. On weekends (Saturday & Sunday), you can wake up at 6:00. However, if you are on vacation, then you can get up at 7:00 on weekdays and 9:00 on weekends.

Write a program to print the time you should get up.

Input Format

Input containing an integer and a boolean value.

The integer tells you the day it is (1-Sunday, 2-Monday, 3-Tuesday, 4-Wednesday, 5-Thursday, 6-Friday, 7-Saturday). The boolean is true if you are on vacation and false if you’re not on vacation.

You have to print the time you should get up.

Example Input:

1 false

Output:

6:00

Example Input:

5 false

Output:

5:00

Example Input:

1 true

Output:

9:00


For example:

Input	Result
1 false
6:00
5 false
5:00
1 true
9:00


import java.util.*;
public class WakeUpTime{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int day = sc.nextInt();
        boolean onVacation = sc.nextBoolean();
        
        String wakeUpTime;
        if(onVacation){
            if(day>=2 && day<=6){
                wakeUpTime = "7:00";
            }
            else {
                wakeUpTime = "9:00";
            }
        }
        else {
            if(day>= 2 && day<= 6){
                wakeUpTime = "5:00";
            }
            else {
                wakeUpTime = "6:00";
            }
        }
        System.out.println(wakeUpTime);
    }
}


Write a program that takes as parameter an integer n.

You have to print the number of zeros at the end of the factorial of n.

For example, 3! = 6. The number of zeros are 0. 5! = 120. The number of zeros at the end are 1.

Note: n! < 10^5

Example Input:

3

Output:

0

Example Input:

60

Output:

14

Example Input:

100

Output:

24

Example Input:

1024

Output:

253

For example:

Input	Result
3
0
60
14
100
24
1024
253


import java.util.Scanner;

public class FactorialTrailingZeros {

    public static int countTrailingZeros(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        
        // Count the number of 5's in factors of n!
        for (int i = 5; n / i >= 1; i *= 5) {
            count += n / i;
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Scanner object to get input from the user
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Get the integer 
        int n = scanner.nextInt();

        // Print the number of trailing zeros in n!
        System.out.println(countTrailingZeros(n));

        // Close the scanner
        scanner.close();
    }
}
